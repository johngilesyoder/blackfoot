          This turnkey adventure travel business is based on an exotic 13.6-acre private island and is one of five islands found at Glover’s Reef Atoll, the most remote and unspoiled atoll in Belize. The business includes 5.3 acres on the windward side of the island bordered both by the open Caribbean to the southeast and a quiet lagoon to the northwest. Glover’s Reef is part of the most famous of Belize’s natural attractions, the Barrier Reef, which stretches in a line 20 to 25 miles offshore for nearly the entire length of the country. The reef is studded with idyllic tropical islands, with the offshore atolls enclosing the most pristine of the reefs found in the country, including the internationally known Blue Hole.
        </p>
        <p>
          The atoll encompasses one of Belize’s protected National Marine Reserves, and has been recognized for its outstanding beauty and pristine condition as a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site. The surrounding reefs, open Caribbean sea, and palm covered beaches rival any tropical island in the Caribbean. Belize is world famous for its scuba diving and pristine barrier reef. It is a truly world class location and boasts the best coral reefs in the western hemisphere.

              The exotic geography of the barrier reef and mountains, the azure Caribbean Sea, and the tropical climate combine to make Belize a highly desirable location to spend time during winter. With satellite internet service on the island, owners could now live right on the island while operating the business. The island resort has 16 rustic guest cabins (which house up to 37 guests) with spectacular ocean views, a shower complex, a kitchen and dining hall complex, cabins for staff, an office with phone and satellite internet system and a large dock on the lagoon. The remaining western half of the island is undeveloped but was recently purchased by a land holding company for re-sale.

            Belize is fast becoming known as a top destination in the adventure travel market, with its extensive nature reserves, coral barrier reef, limestone cave system and jungle habitat. The country also is becoming famous for its archeological treasures from the Mayan civilization and has already established itself as a world-class scuba diving destination and sport fishing paradise. Its tropical setting, safe political climate and excellent infrastructure are attracting ever increasing foreign investments, especially in the tourism sector which has seen phenomenal growth in the last five years. A new $40M airport expansion, new $50M Carnival Cruise Line terminal and the construction of many new hotels and resorts attest to the rapid growth Belize is currently experiencing.

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>
            While the company’s growth rate has remained high in most years, there is much room for growth. The business currently only operates for six months a year and has not maximized its marketing potential. Without much additional capital the season could be extended and a scuba diving facility added. Belize, and Glover’s Reef in particular, are both internationally renowned for their premier diving sites. Sport fishing is another market that has not been developed at Glover’s Reef, and although the atoll is a protected Reserve, catch and release fishing is permitted. With a vigorous and professional marketing campaign, sales would most certainly increase.

            According to the Wildlife Conservation Society, "The Belize Barrier reef is one of the world’s outstanding barrier reef systems, containing a necklace of three offshore atolls, hundreds of sand cays and patch reefs, mangrove forests, coastal lagoons, estuaries and a thriving ecosystem comprised of approximately 500 species of fish, 134 bird species, three varieties of nesting sea turtles, and one of the largest populations of West Indian Manatees." Glover's harbors one of the greatest diversity of reef types in the western Caribbean and is considered one of the highest priority areas in the Mesoamerican reef system. Species frequently seen include iguana, geckos, a variety of dolphins, stingrays, turtles, sharks, eels, grunts, wrasse, bone fish, snapper, angel fish, and many other fish species.  Osprey, falcons, herons, nighthawks, flycatchers, warblers, swallows are just some of the bird species found at Glover’s Reef.
